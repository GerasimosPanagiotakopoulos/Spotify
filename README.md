# Spotify
The "Spotify" project was developed between Anastasia Panopoulou and Gerasimos Panagiotakopoulos as part of a course of the Data Analytics Bootcamp by Big Blue Data Academy (BBDA). We used a Spotify dataset from Kaggle. The data were treated using Python and then they were visualized using the PowerBI dashboard.

## Project Overview
The story behind the project was to find and propose possible periods for a marketing campaign and also, which music to include in the campaign. For this purpose, the dataset was firstly treated with Python. Then, different parameters were visualised in the dashboard of PowerBI to find patterns between them and to focus on key-points.
